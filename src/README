In this file I will try to describe the structure of the Go model MD simulations. I will assume one has already created a settings file and a dat file with the topology of the model. 
0. In MD.com all the common parameters are defined.
1. start: ss.f file. This file creates reads the run settings from settings.dat, reads in the random variables for the random subroutine and creates output files.
2. The second step in the ss.f file is "stophere", which closes all files that are open.
3. ss.f also includes subrutine "initES" which is called if "use electrostatics" is defined as YES. initES defines the cutoff for ES interactions to be applied.
